Release Notes JGroups 2.6.2
===========================

Version: $Id: ReleaseNotes-2.6.2.txt,v 1.2 2008/02/07 09:32:05 belaban Exp $
Author: Bela Ban

JGroups 2.6.2 is still API-backwards compatible with previous versions (down to 2.2.5).
JGroups 2.6.2 is also binary backwards compatible with 2.6 and 2.6.1.

Below is a summary (with links to the detailed description) of the major new features between 2.6.1 and 2.6.2.


Shared transport
----------------
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-631]

When running multiple channels within the same JVM, we can make all channels refer to the same transport
(e.g. UDP, or TCP). The transport then effectively becomes a JVM singleton. Note that the protocols of the
individual stacks can be different, but the shared transport is the same.

The advantage of this is that costly resources like thread pools are shared between channels, reducing overall
resources (e.g. fewer threads).

Compared to MuxChannels, shared transports do *not* change semantics, so there are no service views etc. Additionally,
there is no separate thread pool needed, like in the Multiplexer. So shared transports can be used as a replacement for
MuxChannels.

Bug fixes
---------
AUTH: bug in 2.5 which caused AUTH to fail on second and subsequent JOIN attempts *if* the first
attempt was rejected by AUTH.
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-577]

VIEW_SYNC: there was a regression in 2.5, which causes VIEW_SYNC messages to get dropped.
Note that this bug didn't occur in 2.4.x.

X.509 token not marshalled correctly. This affects ENCRYPT.
