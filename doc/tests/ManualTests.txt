     Manual tests for the Group Membership Service (GMS) Protocol
     ------------------------------------------------------------


Hopefully these tests can be automated some time in the
future. Currently it takes too much time to write automatic tests. The
tests should be executed before releasing a new tarball of JGroups.

- All the tests use the JGroups/Demos/Draw program
- All tests should be run with both FD and FD_SOCK

'Leave' means exit the demo program gracefully, ie. through
"Leave&Exit".
'Kill' means just kill the process id



Test 1
------

- Start A, B
- Leave B
  --> B should leave and window should disappear
  --> A should show 1 member


Test 2
------

- Test 1
- Repeatedly start B and then leave B
  --> A should always show the correct mbrship


Test 3
------

- Start A, B
- Kill B
  --> B should be suspected
  --> A should show 1 member
(run with FD_SOCK first, then with FD only)


Test 4
------

- Test 3
- Repeatedly start B and kill B
  --> A should always show the correct mbrship



Test 5
------

- Start A, B
- Leave A
  --> A should leave and window should disappear
  --> B should be new coordinator
  --> B should show 1 member


Test 6
------

- Start A, B
- Kill A
  --> A should be suspected
  --> B should become new coordinator
  --> B should show 1 member


Test 7
------

- Start A, B, C, D
- Kill B and C
  --> A and D should show 2 members


Test 8
------

- Start A, B, C, D
- Kill A, B, C simultaneously
  --> D should become new coordinator
  --> D should show 1 member


Test 9
------

- (use with FD only)
- Start A, B
- Kill B and immediately restart B
  --> Both A and B should show 2 members


Test 10
-------

- (use with FD only)
- Start A and B
- Kill A (coordinator) and immediately restart A
  --> B should become new coordinator
  --> Both A and B should show 2 members
  --> The new A may try to join the old one (if still around). This
      could result in a Join() timeout until the new coordinator has
      been determined



Test 11
-------

- Start A
- Leave A
  --> A should leave in a short time (no hangs)



Test 12
-------

- (only use with FD)
- Start A, B, C
- Kill A and simultaneously leave C
- C should block until B becomes coordinator (and shows mbrship=2)
- C then leaves B and shows mbrship=1


Test 13
-------
- Start A and B concurrently
- They should form a group of 2


Test 14
-------

- Start 20 instances
- Mbrship should be 20
- Kill and leave members randomly
- Last member should show mbrship=1
[ test with both FD and FD_SOCK ]


Test 15
-------

- Start A, B
- Shun A (CTRL-Z and then fg)
- When B has rejoined the group, kill A
- The view needs to be {B} now
