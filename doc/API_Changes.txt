API changes in 3.0.0
====================

- Old and deprecated system properties such as bind.address (instead of jgroups.bind_addr) have been removed

- Removed package org.jgroups.persistence and changed dependent demos accordingly (e.g. ReplicatedHashMap)

- Removed all options except for Channel.LOCAL
- Removed JChannel.getOpt()/setOpt()
- Discarding of own messages can now be set via setDiscardOwnMessages(true)

- Removed package org.jgroups.mux (e.g. Multiplexer and MuxChannel). Use a shared transport instead. If you have to,
  use classes from package org.jgroups.blocks.mux (only if you're an expert though !)

- Removed (J)ChannelFactory. Inject the channel yourself, e.g. through CDI

- Removed JChannel.receive(). Use a Receiver or ReceiverAdapter and JChannel.setReceiver(Receiver) to switch from a
  pull based approach of receiving messages to a push-based approach

- Removed JChannel.receive(), peek(), shutdown(), open(), returnState(), getAllStates(), blockOK()

- Removed DistributedQueue
