Replication between data centers
================================

We have data centers in New York (NYC) and San Francisco (SFO). The idea is to replicate traffic from NYC to SFO
asynchronously. In case of a site failure of NYC, all clients can be switched over to SFO and continue working with
(almost) up-to-date data.

There is no replication going on from SFO to NYC by default, only when SFO becomes the primary site.

For the example, we assume that each site uses a UDP based stack, and replication between the sites use a
TCP based stack, see figure DataCenterReplication.png.
