Overview
--------
In JBoss we have multiple JGroups channels, one for each block (e.g. JBossCache, ClusterPartition etc). The goal of
the Multiplexer is to combine all stacks with the *same* configuration into one, and have multiple blocks on top
of that same channel.
To do this we have to introduce multiplexing and demultiplexing functionality, ie. each block will have to have
a unique identification (a string), and when sending a message, the message has to be tagged with that ID. When
receiving a message, it will be dispatched to the right block based on the ID attached to the message.
