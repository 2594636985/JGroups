JIRA: https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JGRP-1009

Goal:
-----

We don't want concurrent merges and view changes (join or leave processing). During a merge, join and leave requests
will be discarded. Likewise, during a join/leave processing, merge requests will be discarded.

We already do discard join or leave requests during a merge (ViewHandler is suspended), but not the other way round.

JGRP-1009 leaves to spurious merges: when a join or leave request is being processed and the views are being
disseminated, if a merge is permitted to occur during this, the merge leader might detect different views
(due to them arriving at different members at different times, maybe a few millisconds apart) and initiate a merge.

This won't happen when the merge is discarded during a view processing / installation.

Design:
-------

There are 3 types of events we need to take into acccount:
- The coord receiving a JOIN/JOIN_WITH_STATE/LEAVE/SUSPECT event (anything which leads to a new view being installed)
- The coord receiving a MERGE event (e.g. from MERGE2 somewhere below in the stack)
- The coord receiving a MERGE-REQ request (from a coord in a different partition)

Issues:
-------

- What if the client sends a JOIN_WITH_STATE, the coord processes the JOIN, but suspends the queue after it and before
  processing the GET_STATE ?
