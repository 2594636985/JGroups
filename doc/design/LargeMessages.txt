Requirements
------------
- Large cluster
- 1 sender, many receivers
- Sender sends messages between 10MB and 200MB, in bursts

Goals:
------
- Receivers discard message (purge it from memory) as soon as it has been delivered to the application
- Sender discards message as soon as it has received acks from all receivers or a timeout has elapsed
--> We don't want to keep 200MB messages in buffers longer than necessary


Design:
