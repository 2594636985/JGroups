Gathering writes and scattering reads are not supported in DatagramChannel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- DatagramChannel.read() and write() are only possible if the channel is *connected*
- However, we cannot connect a DatagramChannel as this defeats the purpose of having 1 channels for all sends and receives
- So we have to resort to DatagramChannel.send() and receive(), which work on unconnected channels, but provide no
  support for gathering writes and scattering reads


Direct buffers
--------------
- With the above restriction, they cannot be supported at the DatagramChannel level, only for SocketChannels
