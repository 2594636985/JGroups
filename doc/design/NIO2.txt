NIO.2
=====


Gathering writes and scattering reads are not supported in DatagramChannel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- DatagramChannel.read() and write() are only possible if the channel is *connected*
- However, we cannot connect a DatagramChannel as this defeats the purpose of having 1 channels for all sends and receives
- So we have to resort to DatagramChannel.send() and receive(), which work on unconnected channels, but provide no
  support for gathering writes and scattering reads


Direct buffers
--------------
- With the above restriction, direct buffers (ByteBuffer.allocateDirect()) cannot be supported for DatagramChannels,
  only for SocketChannels



Scattering reads on the receiving side
--------------------------------------
- We could write the JGroups metadata first (e.g. length, version etc), then the Infinispan metadata (put/get), then the
  Infinispan data (key/value, as direct buffer) and do a scattering read into 3 buffers on the receiving side
  - To allocate direct memory for the Infinispan buffer, JGroups would have to invoke a callback (into Infinispan) to
    obtain the buffer (via jemalloc). Not nice...
- However, since scattering reads are not supported by datagram channels, we have to read the *entire* UDP datagram
  packet into a fixed size (65K) buffer
  - If the packet's size is much smaller than 65K (e.g. 10K) we can copy it and pass only the 10K up


Direct buffers and fragmentation
--------------------------------
- Fragmentation _might_ defeat the purpose of direct buffers
- Investigate whether a direct buffer can be broken into multiple direct buffers with different
  offsets and lengths (should be possible)


Async Invocation API and buffer copying
---------------------------------------
- AIA can probably hold on to a buffer since that buffer was read into a new buffer in the transport
- If the JGroups transport reused buffers, this would require a copy at the AIA level





Memory-mapped files for exchange of messages between members on the same box
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- No notifications when data is ready (FileChannel doesn't implement SelectableChannel)




Summary
-------
#1 The biggest advantage of NIO2 is its *asynchronous nature*: non-blocking reads/writes reduce the number of threads
   used for *TCP*. NIO2 doesn't apply to UDP, as we only have 2 sockets (DatagramSocket, MulticastSocket) and 1 thread
   servicing each.

#2 ByteBuffers have no advantage over {byte[],offset,length} tuples; as a matter of fact, each ByteBuffer carries
   additional variables which occupy memory if many ByteBuffers are used
   - If direct memory is used, then ByteBuffers are required: direct ByteBuffers don't allow access to the underlying
     array

#3 For multiple transports, NIO2 is not required

#4 For exchange of messages between member on the same box, NIO2 can be used to access shared memory without having to
   use JNI (memory mapped files)
