Motivation
----------
Merge of sent-table, received-table and delivered-table into one single retransmission table. This should reduce
complexity, and increase performance, because we don't need to handle 3 tables. Plus, sent-table maintained a sorted
key set (TreeMap) which made insertion costly when many keys were present.



Design
------

Variables:
- xmit-table: Map<Address,NakReceiverWindow> of senders and their associated NakReceiverWindows. Each NakReceiverWindow
              contains a map<Long,Message> of sequence numbers and the messages associated with them.
              Each NakReceiverWindow maintains the seqnos of (1) the highest message received, (2) the highest message
              delivered and (3) the lowest message. The latter is the seqno that was last purged through a stability
              message (see STABLE protocol)
