The next version of the transport (org.jgroups.protocols.TP) should be NIO based: TP has an NIO selector, and subclasses
such as TCP or UDP only register NIO channels with TP. For example, UDP would create 2 NIO channels, a unicast and a
multicast channel and register them with TP. TCP would do an accept() in a loop and, whenever a new peer connects,
pass the client's NIO socket channel to TP.

TP would therefore be a multiplexer which handles a number of connections, be they TCP or UDP connections. Therefore,
the connection table functionality of TCP would be largely removed, because this is now handled by TP itself.
