Changes to TCP to make it scale better in a cloud

Problem:
--------

In many cloud services (EC2, rackspace, GAE), IP multicasting is not allowed, therefore users of JGroups have to switch
to TCPGOSSIP:TCP in conjunction with a GossipRouter for initial lookup.

With TCP, we send a cluster wide message to N-1 nodes (with UDP, we send it only once). This doesn't scale with
increasing clusters. Even if we parallelize this, all the traffic from us to each node has to go through the switch,
taxing our full-duplex line to the switch.
