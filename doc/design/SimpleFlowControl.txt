Simple Flow control (SFC)
=========================

SFC is a simple flow control protocol for group (= multipoint) messages.

Every sender has max_credits bytes for sending multicast messages to the group.

Every multicast message (we don't consider unicast messages) decrements max_credits by its size.
When max_credits falls below 0, the sender asks all receivers for new credits and blocks
until *all* credits have been received from all members.

When the receiver receives a credit request, it checks whether it has received max_credits bytes from the requester since
the last credit request. If yes, it sends new credits to the requester and resets the max_credits for the requester.
Else, it takes a note of the credit request from P and - when max_credits bytes have finally been received from P - it
sends the credits to P and resets max_credits for P
