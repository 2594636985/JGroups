Implementation of the SCOPE protocol
====================================

Scopes allow for concurrent message delivery of messages sent by the same sender, without having to resort to
OOB.

A message is tagged as scoped by calling Message.setAScope(short). This will add a SCOPE.ScopeHeader to the message.

The scope can be set *per message*. It should be more or less unique, but doesn't need to be.

All messages with the same scope are delivered in the order in which they were received by the SCOPE protocol. Messages
without scope header are passed up the stack.
