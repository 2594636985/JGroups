Threadless stack
----------------
We will get rid of all queues in the protocols, and their associated threads. This is the same as setting all down_thread
and up_thread vars to false, but now it is the default.

On the rceeiver's side there will be 2 thread pools (Executors): one for regular messages and one for OOB messages.
Whenever an OOB message is encountered, the receiver thread (which called receive()) will call Executor.execute() on the
OOB threadpool with the message as argument, and if it is a regular message it will call Executor.execute() on the
regular thread pool.

The type of Executor is chosen by the user (through configuration): DirectExecutor means we will *not* use a separate
thread, PooledExecutor uses a real thread pool plus a queue in front.
