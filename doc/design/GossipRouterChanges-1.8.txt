Motivation
----------

The changes are mainly due to logical addresses and shared transport.

TCPGOSSIP currently doesn't work, as the GossipRouter doesn't return logical addresses *and* their associated physical
addresses, but only returns logical addresses (UUIDs) [1].

In TUNNEL, RouterStubs are conceptually associated with a single channel, and cannot process traffic from multiple
channels on top of a shared transport.

Design overview
---------------

A RouterStub will simply establish a TCP connection with a GossipRouter, but doesn't send the CONNECT message on
socket establishment. This is typically done in init() of TUNNEL (or TCPGOSSIP).

On channel connection, a CONNECT(groupname, logical_addr, logical_name, physical_addresses) is sent to the
GossipRouter.

On a GET-MEMBERS(groupname), the GR returns a list of <logical-addr, logical-name, physical-addresses> elements.

On a ROUTE(groupname, logical_addr, message), the GR pick the single destination (if logical-addr is not null) and
routes the message. If logical_addr is null, then the GR routes the message to all members keyed by groupname.

The GossipRouter maintains the following data structures:

- Membership:
  - A hashmap with groupnames as keys and (logical) address lists as values
  - This is modified by CONNECT and DISCONNECT messages

- ConnectionTable:
  - A hashmap with logical_addrs as keys and ConnectionEntry's as values. A key represents a single member and a value
    contains Socket, and input and output streams. The ConnectionEntry has a thread listening for messages on the
    input stream, and it also has a list of logical_addrs for which is can receive messages.
  - When the socket in the ConnectionEntry is closed by the peer, we remove all entries associated with all
    logical_addrs of ConnectionEntry from the other data structures.

- AddressMappings:
  - Maintains a hashmap with logical_addrs as keys and the physical_addrs as value
  - This is used to map logical addresses to their physical addresses, and is only used by TCPGOSSIP


Implementation
--------------

RouterStub
----------
- When started, the RouterStub eatsblishes a socket to the GossipRouter's address:port given
- When the connection is closed by the GR, the stub goes into reconnecting mode. When reconnected, it issues
  a notification so registered listeners can send a CONNECT (see below) to the GR again
- When the CONNECT event is received by TUNNEL / TCPGOSSIP, RouterStub.connect() is called with
  - the groupname
  - the logical address
  - the logical name
  - a list of physical addresses (might be null, only used by TCPGOSSIP)
  - This generates a CONNECT message which is sent to the GossipRouter


GossipRouter
------------

- On accept():

- On CONNECT(groupname, logical_addr, logical_name, physical_addrs):

- On DISCONNECT:

- On peer (RouterStub) closing the socket:

- On GET_MEMBERS(groupname):

- On ROUTE(groupname, logical_addr, message):


TUNNEL
------

- On stub reconnect:
