Changes to GossipRouter in 2.8
==============================

Motivation
----------

The changes are mainly due to logical addresses and shared transport.

TCPGOSSIP currently doesn't work, as the GossipRouter doesn't return logical addresses *and* their associated physical
addresses, but only returns logical addresses (UUIDs) [1].

In TUNNEL, RouterStubs are conceptually associated with a single channel, and cannot process traffic from multiple
channels on top of a shared transport.
