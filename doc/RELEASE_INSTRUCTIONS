	       Things to do before packaging a release
	       ---------------------------------------


- Set Trace.debug=false. This will not generate certain trace
  statements in the class files

- [Optionally] Make Trace.trace final and set it to false. Comment out
  all assignments to Trace.trace. This will remove ALL tracing code,
  so we won't be able to enable tracing at runtime. However,
  JavaGroups will be faster.

- Remove all "// +++ remove" statements

- Run all tests in ./tests (runtests)

- Run all demos in ./demos

- cvs tag before releasing
