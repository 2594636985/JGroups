JGroups 2.7 is still API-backwards compatible with previous versions (down to 2.2.5).

Below is a summary (with links to the detailed description) of the major new features.


Thread pools can be replaced in the transport
---------------------------------------------
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-632]

We have 2 thread pools in the concurrent stack: the default and OOB thread pools. These can now be replaced with a custom
user-written thread pool. The only requirement here is that the custom thread pool implements ExecutorService.
This allows for tighter integration of JGroups into a system, e.g. for ISVs which already have a thread pool in their
application, and want JGroups to use it.


Preventing reincarnation through storing of ports in temp storage
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-637]

Reincarnation can be prevented by not reusing recently used ports. All ports are stored ib stable
storage, and purged after some configurable time.
