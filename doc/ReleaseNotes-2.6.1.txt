Release Notes JGroups 2.6.1
===========================

Version: $Id: ReleaseNotes-2.6.1.txt,v 1.1.2.1 2007/11/28 11:50:56 belaban Exp $
Author: Bela Ban

JGroups 2.6.1 is still API-backwards compatible with previous versions (down to 2.2.5).
JGroups 2.6.1 is *binary backwards compatible* with 2.6.

Below is a summary (with links to the detailed description) of the major new features.


Join and state transfer
-----------------------
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-236]

We added another connect() method in JChannel, which combines joining a cluster and fetching the state from the
coordinator into one method. This is especially useful when we have FLUSH in the stack; thus we only have to use 1 rather
than 2 (1 for JOIN, 1 for state transfer) flush phases.


Manual
------
The manual is online at http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/manual/html/index.html

Bug fixes
---------
AUTH: bug in 2.5 which caused AUTH to fail on second and subsequent JOIN attempts *if* the first
attempt was rejected by AUTH.
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-577]

VIEW_SYNC: there was a regression in 2.5, which causes VIEW_SYNC messages to get dropped.
Note that this bug didn't occur in 2.4.x.
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-586]

X.509 token not marshalled correctly. This affects ENCRYPT.
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-576]
