JGroups 2.6 is still API-backwards compatible with previous versions (down to 2.2.5).

Below is a summary (with links to the detailed description) of the major new features.



Improved ReplicatedHashMap
--------------------------
[http://jira.jboss.com/jira/browse/JGRP-581]

ReplicatedHashMap was converted to use generics, and java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap. It therefore supports 4 new
methods putIfAbsent(), remove() and the two replace() methods.
Developers can choose whether to use asynchronous or synchronous replication, and also pick the timeout for synchronous
calls.
This class supersedes ReplicatedHashtable and DistributedHashtable, which will be removed in version 3.0.
