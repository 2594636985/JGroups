Below is a summary (with links to the detailed description) of the major new features, optimizations and bug fixes.




New features
============



RELAY: connecting local (autonomous) clusters into a large virtual cluster
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-747]

A new protocol to connect 2 geographically separate sites into 1 large virtual cluster. The local clusters are
completely autonomous, but RELAY makes them appear as if they were one.

This can for example be used to implement geographic failover

Optimizations
=============


NAKACK: retransmitted messages don't need to be wrapped
-------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1266]

Not serializing retransmitted messages at the retransmitter and deserializing them at the requester saves
1 serialization and 1 deserialization per retransmitted message.








Bug fixes
=========


NAKACK: incorrect digest on merge and state transfer
----------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1251]

When calling JChannel.getState() on a merge, the fetched state would overwrite the digest incorrectly.
