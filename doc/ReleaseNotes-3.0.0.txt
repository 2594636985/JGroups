New features
============

Optimizations
=============


Digest: remove low seqno and compress highest_delivered and highest_received seqnos
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1331]


Umbrella JIRA for a number of optimizations:
- Removed low seqno from digest (memory and wire size reduction)
- Compressed longs and long sequences (wire size reduction)
  - E.g. NakackHeader sequence numbers, retransmission ranges
- JoinRsp wire size reduction
  - 1000-node JoinRsp: 40'000 --> 23'000 bytes


Discovery: don't send view back with discovery response
-------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1315]

The view is now omitted from the discovery response, this cause large messages sent by everyone in the cluster,
especially if we had a large cluster




Bug fixes
=========

UNICAST/UNICAST2: message can get delivered multiple times
----------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1347]

Edge case, happened very infrequently when a participant of a unicast connection closed its end of the connection
unilaterally.


Race condition in RspFilter
---------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1193]


Incorrect state transfer with STREAMING_STATE_TRANSFER if use_default_transport=true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1339]

This was renamed to STATE and JGRP-1339 was fixed.


BARRIER should not block unicast messages
-----------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1341]


Error starting shared transport causes future channels using it to fail
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1356]
