Release Notes JGroups 2.6.13
============================


Author: Bela Ban
Version: $Id: ReleaseNotes-2.6.13.txt,v 1.1.2.1 2009/09/30 14:34:15 belaban Exp $



JGroups 2.6.13 is still API-backwards compatible with previous versions (down to 2.2.7).
It is also binary backwards compatible with all previous patch versions 2.6.X.

The major work done in 2.6.13 was performance related: JGRP-1033 and JGRP-1034 back ported UNICAST and NAKACK from
CVS head to 2.6.x. JGRP-1043 fixed a performance bottleneck in 2.6.x.

A more detailed discussion is at http://belaban.blogspot.com/2009/09/jgroups-2613cr2-released.html.


Below is a summary (with links to the detailed description) of the major new features between 2.6.12 and 2.6.13.
