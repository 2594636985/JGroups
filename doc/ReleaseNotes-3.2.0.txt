Below is a summary (with links to the detailed description) of the major new features, optimizations and bug fixes.




New features
============


RELAY2: multi-site clustering
-----------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1433]
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1401]
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1521]
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1519]

Provides clustering between multiple sites; successor to RELAY (which allowed for only 2 sites). RELAY2 is added to the
top of the stack and relays both multicast and unicast messages between sites (local clusters).
For documentation go to http://www.jgroups.org/manual-3.x/html/user-advanced.html#Relay2Advanced.


I8N logging
-----------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1475]

Use of ResourceBundles to internationalize certain warn and error messages. The JGroups/conf/jg-messages*.properties
files contain the translations. Currently, only German is supported, but support for any language can be added easily,
and without recompilation, e.g. by adding jg-messages_fr.properties (for French) to the classpath.


Suppress identical log warnings
-------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1518]

Sometimes we get a lot of log messages about the same problem, e.g. messages from a non-member, from a different cluster
or from a member running a different version of JGroups.
We can now suppress indentical warnings for a given period of time, so the logs don't get blown up beyond proportion.



Optimizations
=============




Bug fixes
=========

GroupRequest: received and suspected is counted twice
-----------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1505]

This could lead to premature termination of blocking RPCs.



NAKACK / NAKACK2: modification of headers leads to unneeded retransmissions
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1502]

When copying messages on a retransmission, the headers are not copied. When NAKACK{2} therefore modifies a header
in place, we're changing the type of the message (normal message --> retransmit message). This is not incorrect, but
leads to unneeded retransmissions.


RSVP: incorrect updating of membership response list
----------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1503]

This could lead to TimeoutExceptions when a new view was received before the call terminated.


MessageDispatcher allows sending of messages on a closed channel
----------------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1508]

This can lead to timeouts as a caller may block waiting for response values, which will never be received as the channel
is closed. Now an exception is thrown when we attempt to send a message via MessageDispatcher on a closed or unconnected
channel. This is the same behavior now as with channel.


NAKACK / NAKACK2: flushing queued messages on joining the cluster might lead to failed joins
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JGRP-1522]

When a new member joins, it flushes messages it received before becoming a server (optimization introduced in 3.2 to
prevent retransmission). However, if any of the flushed messages sends a message in the same thread, this will hit
an unconnected channel (the channel isonly connected after the JChannel.connect() call returns), so an exception
will be thrown and JChannel.connect() fails.
