AUTH
----
AUTH is a protocol directly under GMS, which allows to authenticate members who want to join a group. Based on a
pluggable authentication mechanism, new members are either admitted or rejected. In the latter case, Channel.connect()
will fail with a security exception.
For details see JGroups/doc/design/AUTH.txt.

Sequencer based total order protocol
------------------------------------
SEQUENCER is an improved implementation of total order, and faster than TOTAL. When sending a message to
the group, the sender sends the message via unicast to the coordinator, who then broadcasts the message
(on behalf of the sender) to all members, with a unique sequence number. The coordinator uses FIFO,
but since there is only 1 sender, this results in total order.
SEQUENCER can be used for example to maintain identical replicas of a (JMS) queue: senders and receivers can
send and receive messages to/from any queue replica simultaneously, without affecting the consistency
of all replicas across the cluster.
A quick 2 node performance test (perf.Test) with 2 million 1K messages showed
ca 6500 messages/sec with sequencer.xml, compared to ca. 10500 messages/sec with fc-fast-minimalthreads.xml.
For details see JGroups/doc/design/SEQUENCER.txt.

ENCRYPT enhancements
--------------------
The encrypt_entire_message flag (if set to true) will now encrypt the entire message (including the headers),
as opposed to only encrypting the message buffer. Note that this operation requires serialization of the message,
so setting this option to true is expensive. Why use it ? When one wants to prevent eavesdroppers from snooping
out information located in the (non-encrypted) headers, such as sequence numbers.



Incompatibilities to previous version
-------------------------------------
Changed method signature of the RpcDispatcher.callRemoteMethod() methods to throw a Throwable.
Previously they returned the exception as an object, now the exception will be thrown.
Callers of these methods have to change their code, so this is an incompatible change. However,
these calls are not used in JBossCache and JBoss Clustering.

Enhancements and bug fixes
--------------------------
FD_SOCK now uses the bind address of the transport unless a bind_addr is specifically
specified, or the -Dbind.address system property is used
