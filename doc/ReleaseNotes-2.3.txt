Sequencer based total order protocol
------------------------------------
SEQUENCER is an improved implementation of total order, and faster than TOTAL. When sending a message to
the group, the sender sends the message via unicast to the coordinator, who then broadcasts the message
(on behalf of the sender) to all members, with a unique sequence number. The coordinator uses FIFO,
but since there is only 1 sender, this results in total order.
SEQUENCER can be used for example to maintain identical replicas of a (JMS) queue: senders and receivers can
send and receive messages to/from any queue replica simultaneously, without affecting the consistency
of all replicas across the cluster.
A quick 2 node performance test (perf.Test) with 2 million 1K messages showed
ca 6500 messages/sec with sequencer.xml, compared to ca. 10500 messages/sec with fc-fast-minimalthreads.xml.
For details see JGroups/doc/SEQUENCER.txt.


Bug fixes
---------
FD_SOCK now uses the bind address of the transport unless a bind_addr is specifically
specified, or the -Dbind.address system property is used
