Release Notes JGroups 2.5.2
===========================

Version: $Id: ReleaseNotes-2.5.2.txt,v 1.1.2.1 2008/01/25 19:37:39 rachmatowicz Exp $

JGroups 2.5.2 is a patch release for 2.5 GA. It contains no new functionality, but some 
limited feature requests and primarily bug fixes.


IMPORTANT NOTE:

JGroups 2.5.2 is also an EOL (End of Line) release for JGroups 2.5 - meaning that it
represents the last release of JGroups 2.5.x. The reason is that 2.4.x is used in 
JBoss EAP 4, 2.6.2 will be used in EAP 5, and 2.5.x is somewhat orphaned in between. 
Any bugs found in 2.5 will only get fixed in 2.6. It is a simple matter to switch 
from 2.5 to 2.6.


Manual
------
The manual is online at http://www.jgroups.org/javagroupsnew/docs/manual/html/index.html


Bug fixes
---------
GMS: A concurrency-related exception which was preventing successful group merges and necessitated
shutdown of the enire group.
[JGRP-611] - MergeTask GMS ConcurrentModificationException

SEQUENCER: SEQUENCER provides total ordering of messages. This issue caused total ordering to be 
violated in circumstances involving concurrent sends.
[JGRP-607] - SEQUENCER: incorrect ordering on concurrent sends

RPC DISPATCHER: The callRemoteMethods() method would hang on some processes within a group during
periods where group membership was changing significantly. 
[JGRP-620] - RpcDispatcher.callRemoteMethods() hangs

Feature Requests
----------------
REINCARNATION: reincarnation occurs when a group member crashes and upon restart assumes the 
identity of a member known previously to the group, which leads to anomalous behaviour.
[JGRP-130] - Problems with reincarnation 

Tasks
-----
CHANNEL OPTIONS: Shunned channels will now automatically attempt to rejoin the group, and fetch
the state from the coordinator by default.
[JGRP-651] - JChannel: set auto_reconnect and auto_getstate to true by default
