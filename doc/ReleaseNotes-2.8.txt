Bug fixes
=========

Merge and UNICAST sequencing problem
------------------------------------
[https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JGRP-659]

During a merge, the seqnos in UNICAST could get screwed up and UNICAST would either buffer all subsequent messages,
resulting in out-of-memory exceptions, or discard them, resulting in missing messages. Fixed vy a redesign of UNICAST,
the design is described in JGroups/doc/design/UNICAST.new.txt.


Shared transport: 'members' variable incorrect
----------------------------------------------
[https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JGRP-910]

The cluster name and local address variable made no sense in a shared transport. The solution was to get these vars
from TP$ProtocolAdapter


MERGE: issue with overlapping merges (NAKACK / UNICAST)
-------------------------------------------------------
[https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JGRP-940]

Fixed issues when merge sub partitions overlapped, e.g. {A,B} with {B,C,D}


MERGE: merging digests based on hearsay
---------------------------------------
[https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JGRP-948]

When a merge happens, we get digests from all members. However, every digest contains information about *all*
cluster members. Any information about a member P which doesn't originate from P itself can be stale. The solution
was to ignore digests about P not sent by P itself


MERGE: UNICAST can lose messages on merging
-------------------------------------------
[https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JGRP-952]

Extreme edge case ! However, the redesign of UNICAST (JGroups/doc/design/UNICAST.new.txt) fixes this issue.
