=================

Problem:
Merge, join and leave requests need to handled in the order in which they arrive. Currently,
the merge handling is independent from the view handling, which results in problems with generating
merge VIDs which are lower than the highest VIDs generated by the view handling

Proposed solution:
- Turn the ViewBroadcaster into a ViewHandler which has a queue
- JOIN, LEAVE and MERGE requests received by the coordinator simply create an entry for the queue
- A thread dequeues elements from that queue and processes them, one at a time, to ensure FIFO handling
  of those requests
  --> One result of this is that the merge handling is now *not* done asynchronously anymore !
