JGroups 2.9 is API-backwards compatible with previous versions (down to 2.2.7).

Below is a summary (with links to the detailed description) of the major new features.


New features
============


Optimization of unicast requests
--------------------------------
[https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JGRP-1123]

Invoking unicast RPCs has always been seen as a special case of a group request (1 target member). This was
changed, e.g. we don't need a hashmap for collecting responses from multiple members, but simply a single
response value. Uses less memory, and has less locking (= reduced contention).




Bug fixes
=========

Duplicate delivery of messages
------------------------------
[https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JGRP-1103]

Under load some messages could get delivered more than once. This is a regression, caused by an optimization, and does
not exists in prior versions. Part of the optimizations were reversed to fix this.
