Tips and tricks
---------------

- Use the flags -Xmx500M and -Xms500M, set them to the same initial value
- Use -verbose:gc to track garbage collections
- Use the log4j.properties file shipped with JGroups. Using simply "org.jgroups=warn"
  seems to throttle the sender a few nanosecs to get some better perf. Have to
  investigate further
